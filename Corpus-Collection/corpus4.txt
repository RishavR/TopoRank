There are just five laps to go of the 57 lap 2016 Bahrain Grand Prix and Ive got about enough fuel for four and change. Complicating matters even further my tyres are on the brink of ruin specifically my front left which Ive been loading up and brutalising around every one of Bahrains beefy right handers.

I need to make a call pit now and lose a few spots I wont have time to claw back or go for broke and risk it all. Ninety minutes of racing have reached a dramatic crescendo a white knuckle dash to the finish line in a car that may or may not make it. This is brilliant stuff. In just my second career race F1 2016 has swallowed me up in its Formula One fantasy. Furiously fast satisfyingly stressful and utterly exhausting F1 2016 isnt just Codemasters best F1 game to date it may just be the best F1 racer ever.

Back in Bahrain I losing grip and the sharpness has gone from the steering. Jeff my race engineer wants me to pit because he knows as well as I do that a puncture is imminent a similar scenario last round at Melbourne turned my scrappy top 10 finish into a disappointing 17th as I limped around the last sector of Albert Park and sheepishly slunk into the pits with just a single lap to go.

The difference here however is that Im in the lead with a several second gap back to Nico Rosberg in his purportedly untouchable Merc. I dial down the fuel to its leanest setting tell Jeff to shut up via the handy voice commands and focus on making my car as wide as possible. Rosberg closes fast but I shut the door on him on every bend. The straights are trickier to defend but slowly tracing from one side of the road to the other before darting back over just inside the racing line seems to be stopping him from galloping past me in the DRS zones.
