Trump flew to the capital Riyadh overnight on Air Force One becoming the only president to make Saudi Arabia or any majority Muslim country his first stop overseas as president.
His arrival following a 6700 mile flight was met with the pomp usually reserved for the likes of a Papal welcome in South America. 
The president got the red carpet treatment literally and some airport workers took off their shoes before manicuring it with brooms in 97 degree heat.
The Saudi King later presented Trump with the kingdoms top civilian honor the gold King Abdulaziz medal at the royal court.
After a welcome ceremony inside the Royal Terminal Trump and Salman sat together in The Beast the White Houses armored SUV that travels in the belly of Air Force One. 
The first stop was the glitzy Ritz-Carlton whose exterior is being lit up at night with giant projected images of the American flag.
Trumps first overseas speech is expected to frame the global fight against ISIS and other Islamist terror groups as a battle between good and evil but early drafts suggest he will not use the phrase radical Islamic terrorism.
He will also call on leaders in the Middle East to drive out terrorists from your places of worship.
Signs of American caution are everywhere as the president who once campaigned on the strength of excluding Muslims from the US ventured into the nation whose king partners in construction with the Bin Laden Group.
US military snipers stood guard on nearby jetways. A duplicate Air Force One 747 jet stood by lest Trumps schedule should be waylaid by engine trouble.
Wearing a dark suit and a bright blue tie the president descended stairs from his exclusive plane with first lady Melania Trump after staff including his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner arm in arm exited from the rear of the aircraft.
